<description>An introductory course designed to introduce the student with little or no knowledge of the language to the Portuguese-speaking world. Focuses on fundamental communication skills -- listening, speaking, reading, and writing -- and, at the same time, provides exposure to Portuguese-speaking cultures through media broadcasts, literature, films, music, and videos.</description>
