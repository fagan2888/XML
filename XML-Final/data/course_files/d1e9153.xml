<description>This proseminar introduces students to some of the main themes and core literature in the history of modern Africa. The focus of this proseminar will be on the major questions that have dominated the historiography, as well as current and future trends in the field. Sources and methods will be an implicit part of this course, as will theory, ranging from classical theorists, such as Marx and Weber, to more recent theorists such as the Comaroffs, Chakrabarty, and others. This course is designed to let students sample ways of interpreting the histories of modern Africa, and to provide a framework that will enable them to think critically when reading the field on their own.</description>
