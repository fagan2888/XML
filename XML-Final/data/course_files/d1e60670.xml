<description>This introductory choreography course utilizes movement exploration to tap into the participant's aesthetic and interpretive skills as they are challenged to make dances. Explorations into the use of time, weight and space inform their creative process. Through a combination of readings, writings, discussions, videos and dance improvisation, the course focuses on how movement choices develop dances that are kinesthetic, dramatic, and artistic for both the performer and the audience. No previous dance experience necessary.</description>
