<description>This course examines global migration and the sociopolitical responses of national communities to this phenomenon. In the first half of the course, students consider the process of international migration, and the dynamics of immigration policy, border control and citizenship. In the second half, students address contemporary approaches to settlement, integration and political incorporation. The course concludes by evaluating the impact of transnational affiliations and supranational governance on a process that conventionally has been overseen by national authorities. At hand each week are some of the great social and political debates confronting American society and many other countries today.</description>
