<description>Is the stage of the past the "other" of modern theater? We will explore the relationship between classicism and modernity by considering a set of plays representative of central trends in French drama from the early modern age to contemporary times. Readings include the most famous playwrights of both the 17th (Moliere, Corneille, Racine) and the 20th-21st centuries (Sartre, Badiou, Lagarce, N'Diaye). Special emphasis paid to the ideological power of images through theatrical workshops and video versions of recent productions. The final project consists of an excerpt to be performed in French.</description>
