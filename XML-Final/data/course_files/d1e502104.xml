<description>Practices of piety that are also acts of protest provide access to contemporary developments relating religion, gender and sexuality. This course historicizes current women's cultures of protest within, against and on behalf of their religious faiths. Case studies drawn primarily from Judaism, Christianity and Islam include ecological critiques; the resurgence of the veil in Islam; the ordination of women; the return to orthodoxy in Judaism; as well as consolidations of heterosexuality. The course concludes by interrogating international iconoclastic political protests in light of earlier feminist art work in which the female body is a site of piety and protest, such as Judy Chicago's The Dinner Party.</description>
