<description>What is our experience of architecture in cinema? Considering the relation of these two arts of space, we look at how film and architecture are linked in history on the "screen" of the modern age. Highlighting the interaction of modernity, urban culture and cinema, we explore the architecture of film in relation to the architectures of transit and the culture of travel. Emphasis on readings and case study analysis to pursue research projects and conduct presentations.</description>
