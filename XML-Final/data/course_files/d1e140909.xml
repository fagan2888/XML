<description>This course will ask if the US defense industrial complex facilitates victory by technological innovation. We define defense technologies in three categories: 1) Convenience Technologies, 2) Sustainability Technologies, and 3) Decisive Technologies. If we define Decisive Technologies as those technologies that are strategically managed and tactically deployed, the last century may have seen only two: radar and the atomic bomb. We will debate money as a weapon system and whether or not it is a valid weapon technology. We will examine technologies introduced during the Global War on Terror (GWOT) and ask which category they fall in, if they were a true technological innovation, and if they facilitated victory in a battle vs war. We will discuss barriers to innovation and technological surprise on the battlefield.</description>
