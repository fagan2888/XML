<description>The Tang was not only one of the largest and culturally cosmopolitan periods in Chinese history, it played a pivotal role in the formation of a shared "East Asian" culture. By looking at the history, literature, social and religious thought, and visual culture of the Tang, we will address a series of questions about historical culture: what are the presumptions and strengths of different disciplines and is it possible to cross them to some unified understanding? To what degree is our knowledge shaped by what gets recorded and what materially survives? How much of our understanding of a period is shaped by subsequent ages?</description>
