<description>This course will provide an in-depth examination of the biblical idea of divine election, that is. the notion that God specially favors certain individuals and nations, a notion that sits at the heart of ancient Israel's theological self-understanding. Beginning with the narratives of sibling rivalry in Genesis and then turning to other relevant texts from the Hebrew Bible (all read in English), as well as on occasion from the Apocrypha, the New Testament and rabbinic literature, we shall explore how the Hebrew Bible conceives of election, what it entails for those chosen, and what the Hebrew Bible's election theology implies about the three-way relationship among God, Israel, and the nations of the world, and conclude by surveying how early Christianity and rabbinic Judaism each appropriated ancient Israel's election theology in unique but related ways.</description>
