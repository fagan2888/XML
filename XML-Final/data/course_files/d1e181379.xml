<description>"Dirty and Dangerous" explores the relationship between people and the material world by focusing on the "dark side" of natural and human-made environments. How have people in the US perceived and experienced dangers associated with climate, landscape, toxins, disease, and the built environment? Focusing on the late 19th century until today, the course is organized around three types of environment: wilderness, homes, and workplace. We will draw on a range of sources, including poetry, fiction, films, activist writing, historical scholarship, and a "Toxic Tour" of Boston, examining dangers, fears and anxieties about these various environments in their historical context.</description>
