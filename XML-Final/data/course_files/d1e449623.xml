<description>Martin Heidegger was perhaps the most important and influential philosopher in the Continental tradition in the 20th century, yet the source of his influence has not been fully explored. To that end, we shall trace the development of his thought from his recently published lectures on Aristotle to Being and Time and his later works. Thus, we shall rediscover Heidegger as he appeared to young undergraduates in the early 1920s who would go on to develop some of the most powerful currents of contemporary social thought.</description>
