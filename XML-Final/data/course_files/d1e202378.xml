<description>Even before the formal establishment of the United States, assumptions about sex have helped determine who is entitled to - and not entitled to - the privileges and protections of full citizenship. This course investigates the roles that sex, race, gender, and sexuality have played in configuring notions of citizenship over time as well as the ways in which sexual rights remain a site of contestation and struggle in the modern United States.</description>
