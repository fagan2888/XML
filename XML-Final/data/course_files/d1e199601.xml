<description>Alternative ways of thinking about contemporary market economies and their reconstruction, explored in three contexts: the recent worldwide financial and economic crisis and the struggle for recovery, the effort to advance socially inclusive economic growth in richer as well as in poorer countries, and the character and consequences of globalization. Special attention given to the relation between institutional alternatives at the level of the economy as a whole and organizational alternatives at the level of the firm. In considering these substantive themes, we also explore the nature of economics as a discipline: its past, present, and future. Students should have some acquaintance with economics, but no advanced training is required.</description>
