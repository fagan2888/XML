<description>Analyzes the markers of societal success and the social conditions that sustain it. Discusses various indicators ranging from the standard economic measures to the human development index, inequality, resilience to shocks, educational, child development and health measures. Considers the role of cultural and institutional buffers (how cultural repertoires and myths feed strong collective identities, cultural and institutional supports for coping with stigma, models of citizenship and immigration, and multi-level governance and their impact on welfare and poverty). Similarly addresses factors that present major challenges, or 'wicked problems', like concentrated urban poverty, well-being of indigenous and other racialized groups and some of the solutions attempted. Particular attention will be put on the United States, Canada, and other advanced industrial societies and to the role of space, institutions, and culture in shaping the conditions for successful societies. Public policy implications will also be discussed.</description>
