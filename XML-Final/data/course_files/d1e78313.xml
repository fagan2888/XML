<description>This tutorial is designed to deepen and extend the student's knowledge of the study of East Asian religions. It will build on the student's foundational understanding of the development and history of Buddhism, Daosim, Confucianism, Shinto, and various forms of popular religion, by situating that material in the context of larger issues in the study of East Asian religions. The overarching concern within this tutorial will be on reading and discussing methodologically oriented scholarship that will introduce the student to new and intellectually engaging approaches to the various traditions covered.</description>
