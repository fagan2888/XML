<description>This course will survey the life and writings of the third-century Christian writer, Origen of Alexandria, widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential theologians of late antiquity. Much attention will be given to his overall cosmological frame, including such notions as double creation, salvation understood as pedagogy or embodied rehabilitation, and universal salvation understood as apokatastasis&lt;/I&gt; or the restoration of all things. Attention will also be paid to his scriptural exegesis, and how the practice of biblical interpretation fits into his overall cosmology and soteriology.</description>
