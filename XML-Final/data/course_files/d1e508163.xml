<description>Working from a proposal approved in advance by the instructor, each student plans, shoots, and edits a documentary video of his or her design. Shooting should take place over the summer and editing during the fall term. Readings and screenings augment individual work.</description>
<prerequisites>At least one VES half-course in live-action film or video.</prerequisites>
<notes>In exceptional cases, a student will be permitted to take the course without having filmed over the summer, but the student must have a specific proposal for a documentary that can be both shot and edited during the term. An interview with the instructor is required for admission.</notes>
