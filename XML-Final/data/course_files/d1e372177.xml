<description>Both poetry and the art of painting in medieval Persianate cultures developed to a high level of artistic excellence in the context of court patronage. This course examines that development through the epic tradition in medieval Persian poetry and prose including long narratives in heroic, romance, folk and ethical genres. The course considers the affinities and differences between these and epic tales from other traditions as well as their interactions with Persian painting and manuscript illustration. Beginning with the Parthian romance of Vis and Ramin and the heroic epic of Shahnameh, the survey will continue with epic romances of Nizami, prose narratives about folk heroes such as Abu Muslimnameh, and didactic epics by Sa`di and others.</description>
