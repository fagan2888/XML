<description>The medieval imagination was the ambiguous mediator between the world and the mind: a mental space in which either prophetic truths or dreams and diabolic deceptions might be experienced, in which material and spiritual realities were reflected as in a mirror, and in which those complex constructs we call "fictions" found their source. This course investigates dream poetry and visionary writing in the context of medieval psychological theory. Texts to be read include Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, The Romance of the Rose, Dante's Divine Comedy, John of Morigny's Book of Flowers, and works by Augustine, Julian of Norwich, and others.</description>
