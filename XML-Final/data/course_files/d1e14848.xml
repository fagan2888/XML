<description>The Moche or Northern Peru were among the earliest state societies in the New World. Emerging from simpler levels of economic and political complexity, the Moche developed degrees of political and territorial organization never seen before in the region; developed into a peculiar form of multiple territorial states and, by the 9th century, collapsed and transformed themselves into rather different cultural manifestations. Thus they describe, full circle, the life and times of the first attempts to consolidate political structures of great complexity. In this course we will analyze several aspects of the processes in several regions, form the economic basis of the Moche states, the ideological basis for their legitimation systems, to their collapse and transformation to the even more complex Chimu and Lambayeque phenomena.</description>
