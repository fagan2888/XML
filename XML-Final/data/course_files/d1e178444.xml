<description>Taken up by many ethnic groups in America, the short story has been used to convey experiences with immigration and assimilation, discrimination and oppression, generational divides, and interactions across difference. Examination of such short stories opens up readers to a deeper understanding of America's multiethnic landscape. Together we will examine historical context for the short story's ongoing role in American culture, its relationship with publishing houses and critics, as well as its adaptability to new technologies. Reading Toni Morrison, Jhumpa Lahiri, Junot Diaz, and Sherman Alexie, among others, we will consider ties that both link and divide our multiethnic world.</description>
