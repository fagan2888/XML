<description>The philosophical writings of the seventh century Indian scholar Candrak&amp;#299rti became increasingly influential in late Indian Buddhism and during the Second Dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet. Since then the interpretation of his thought has occupied a prominent place in the intellectual history of Buddhism. The primary goal of this course is to examine Candrak&amp;#299rti's philosophical ideas through studying his major writings in translation. We will pursue this objective with an attention to Candrak&amp;#299rti's intellectual context and the reception of his work. Prior study of Indian philosophy or Buddhist intellectual history will be helpful but there is no prerequisite for this course.</description>
