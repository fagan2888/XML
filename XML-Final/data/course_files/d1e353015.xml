<description>Blackface Minstrelsy in 19th Century America. A theatrical genre that traded in racist caricature, blackface minstrelsy was one of the most popular entertainments of the 19th century U.S., with a legacy that has continued into American popular music and culture today. This course explores the historical development and intense paradoxes of blackface performance by drawing upon materials in the Harvard Theatre Collection, which houses one of the largest minstrelsy archives in the world. The class will culminate in curating an exhibit. Core aspects of the course include grappling with complex questions of racial stereotyping and exploring the banjo in sound and image. Guest experts include a banjo virtuoso, a performer in an African American string band, and a minstrelsy scholar.</description>
