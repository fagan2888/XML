<description>The Harvard Dance Project (HDP) cultivates invention. This faculty-led, student performance company gives students the opportunity to be original cast members and collaborators in two or more diverse dance works created by professional choreographers, including a new installation by Dance Director, Jill Johnson, in the fall term of 2014. The project focuses on performance research, collaboration, and choreographic composition, and links choreographic thinking to other fields. It is a studio based course which includes at least nine performances at major venues on campus. The HDP aims to cultivate invention, foster the courage of artistry, and expose students to top artists in the field today.</description>
