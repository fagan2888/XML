<description>An introductory language course designed for Spanish-speakers. Along with the fundamental communication skills-understanding, speaking, reading and writing-the course will focus on those features of Portuguese which are most difficult for Spanish speakers: pronunciation, idioms and grammatical structures particular to Portuguese. Students will be introduced to the cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world through readings and authentic materials, including films, music, and videotapes.</description>
