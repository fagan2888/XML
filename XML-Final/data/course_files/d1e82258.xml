<description>Written texts are never separate from the material culture in which they are embedded. In premodern societies as in modern ones, the written word is an inseparable part of objects, both those in and on which it is written, and those in which it is stored, on which it is read, which it describes and alongside which it is placed. In the case of premodern Japan, the aesthetic and technological developments that produce new forms of material culture are often mirrored in literature, and vice versa. Therefore this course is designed as a survey of both premodern Japanese literature (in English translation) from the 8th through 19th centuries, and of the material and visual culture of those same eras. This course aims to explore the correspondences and differences among various texts and objects in premodern Japan,and in doing so introduce students to the possibilities of a multidisciplinary approach to scholarship in the humanities.</description>
