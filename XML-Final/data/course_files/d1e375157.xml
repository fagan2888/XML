<description>In 1926, the Yiddish novelist Dovid Bergelson announced the "three centers" of Yiddish literature and culture: New York, Warsaw and Moscow. Using Bergelson's essay as a window on Yiddish modernism, this class looks at the relationship between language, city, and state. We will ask, what distinguished Yiddish culture in one place from another? Did writers see themselves at home or in exile? How did politics affect the Yiddish writer? And what should we make of the other Yiddish centers, Vilna, Kiev, even Berlin?</description>
