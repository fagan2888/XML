<description>Semiclassical approaches to quantum systems provide both intuitive understanding of quantum processes and methods for calculations that are vastly simpler than full quantum mechanical simulations. Semiclassical methods are based on classical mechanics including interference and phases computed with classical actions. The course, based on a textbook being written by Prof. Heller (The Semiclassical Way to Quantum Mechanics) begins with a review of some salient features of classical physics, followed by an introduction to stationary phase integration and the Feynman Path Integral in the semiclassical limit, including time and energy domains, and the famous Trace Formula. This is followed by a number of widely useful techniques, such as generalized tunneling, applications to classically chaotic systems, semiclassical wave packet dynamics, WKB methods and uniformization. A number of "special topics" will then be taken up, including decoherence, certain forms of spectroscopy, and scattering theory of nanoscale devices.</description>
