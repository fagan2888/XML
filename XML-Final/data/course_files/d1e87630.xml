<description>Introduction to economic issues and basic principles and methods of microeconomics: how markets work, market efficiency and market failure, firm and consumer behavior, policy issues such as taxation, international trade, the environment, and the distribution of income.</description>
<prerequisites/>
<notes>Microeconomics (taught in the fall term) is a prerequisite for macroeconomics (taught in the spring term). Students may elect to take only the fall microeconomics course and receive a half-course credit. Taught in a mixture of lectures and small sections. No calculus is used, and there is no mathematics background requirement. Designed for both potential Economics concentrators and those who plan no further work in the field. The Department of Economics strongly encourages students considering concentration to take the full-year course in their freshman year. This is a required course for all economics concentrators and a prerequisite for higher level courses in economics. This course, when taken for a letter grade together with Economic 10b, meets the General Education requirement for either Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning or United States in the World, but not both.</notes>
