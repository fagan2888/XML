<description>A close look at practices and cultural productions of Tibetan Buddhism and other religious traditions in light of their distinctive historical contexts in Tibet. Topics include: yogic, lay, and monastic religions; visionary practices; religion, magic and the state; Buddhism in literature and art; medicine and Buddhism; death and reincarnation practices; the creation of sacred landscape; and certain distinctive literary genres including "mind training," "advice" writings, self-revelatory autobiography; and religious historiography. Throughout the course we will be considering a number of new publications that have recently enriched our understanding of Tibetan religious cultures and institutions.</description>
