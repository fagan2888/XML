<description>An inquiry into basic moral beliefs and their metaphysical assumptions in the high cultures of Western and Eastern civilizations. The background concern is our struggle, in philosophy, religion, and art, with nihilism: the fear that our lives and the world itself may be meaningless. The foreground theme is the contrast between two answers to the question about how to live one's life: stay out of trouble and look for trouble. How speculative thought has dealt with the limits of insight into what matters most. Exemplary writings from several traditions: modern European, ancient Greek, Chinese, South Asian.</description>
