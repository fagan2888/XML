<description>This seminar addresses central issues in the philosophy of healthcare, investigating how some fundamental questions in this field have been answered and exploring alternatives. Questions addressed include: What is health? What is healthcare? Does health have special moral significance? Is there a human right to health? Why do persons and communities differ in their health outcomes and when are these differences considered unjust? Are we responsible for our own health outcomes? The course focuses on questions of class, race, gender and aging in its discussion of justice in health and examines ethical questions in global health.</description>
