<description>A survey-style course that recreates several major moments of intersection between Polish and Jewish literatures. Both of these categories can be understood as placeholders for larger constellations of culture: from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to the Ashkenazic Pale. Starting with the medieval ghetto, the presence/absence of Polish Jews in Polish cultural memory forms one line of inquiry; Polin as a present/absent homeland in Jewish thought from the 16th through 21st centuries forms another. These two cultures have been intertwined for longer than they have been considered separately; we read them in order to place them once again in dialogue.</description>
