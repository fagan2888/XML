<description>In classical Athens, litigants represented themselves before hundreds of jurors who rendered verdicts without instruction from a judge. We will read surviving Athenian court speeches involving homicide, assault, adultery, prostitution, slander, treason, citizenship, and commerce, as well as Plato's account of Socrates' defense speech. Taught by a law professor, the focus will be on comparing ancient and modern approaches to problems faced by all legal systems and on evaluating Athens' distinctively amateur legal system. Students will be expected to write one 5-page paper, to contribute to and lead one class discussion, and to participate in a "mock trial" of an Athenian homicide case.</description>
