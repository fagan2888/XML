<description>From the Middle East to the Pacific rim, Russia is re-emerging as a major player on the world stage. Russia has transitioned in significant ways since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union ("the evil empire"), just as it did during the tumultuous aftermath of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that ended a 300-year imperial dynasty. Through in-depth, interdisciplinary examination of six key themes with contemporary as well as historical resonance (conquest, political terror, the environment, commerce, imaginative representations, and mobility), we will investigate the evolving concept of "Russianness" in a global context. Assignments include curation of a "Russia in the World" digital exhibit.</description>
