<description>During much of the 20th century, the Broadway musical stood at the center of American culture, producing tunes and tales that became the hits of their day. It commented-wittily, satirically, relentlessly-on the ever-shifting social and political landscape, with subjects ranging from new immigrants to poverty, power, westward expansion, and issues of race. This course explores the musical artistry and cultural resonances of a cluster of iconic Broadway musicals on stage and screen, including Shuffle Along, Show Boat, Stormy Weather, The Cradle Will Rock, Oklahoma!, and Pacific Overtures. Readings focus on primary sources drawn from Harvard's illustrious Theatre Collection.</description>
