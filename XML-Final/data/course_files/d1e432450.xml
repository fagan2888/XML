<description>From printed books to digital text, how does technology change the making of poetry and its criticism? From the study of canonical works and their analyses by literary critics to the examination of contemporary poetry and some of its most prominent scholars, the course explores how (or whether) Brazilian poetry and literary criticism are changing in the digital era. Students will be constantly invited to respond to Brazilian poetry and literary criticism through essays, close readings, and translations, among other scholarly projects.</description>
