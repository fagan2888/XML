<description>For students with the equivalent of one semester previous study of Spanish. Emphasis on strengthening students' interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational skills in both oral and written Spanish. Hispanic cultures are presented through a variety of authentic texts, including short pieces of literature, essays, and newspaper articles. Music, art, and film are also included. After Spanish Aa and Ab, students should be able to engage in everyday conversations with native speakers, and read straightforward texts, both fiction and non-fiction, with relative ease.</description>
