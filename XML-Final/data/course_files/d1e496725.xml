<description>Beginning with the religious cultures of Native Americans, and concluding with the religious implications of the American Civil War, this course will survey four centuries of religious history. It will focus on the evolutions of religious thought, the interplay of religious practice with secular culture, religious lives in both mainstream and marginalized groups, and the relationship of church and state. It will also consider the denominational development of numerous movements (e.g., Congregationalists, Friends, Baptists, Shakers, Disciples of Christ, Seventh-day Adventists).</description>
