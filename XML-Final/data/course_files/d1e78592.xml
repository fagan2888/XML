<description>In this course, we will explore the histories, doctrines, rituals, and practices of the major religious traditions of Korea, including Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity, as well as Shamanism and new religions. We will look at how these religions have interacted with each other, as well as the ways in which they have been both influenced and been shaped by Korean culture and politics. We will also pay close attention to the ways in which Korea has developed its own distinctive religious traditions on the basis of active interactions with those of other countries: Korea was exposed to Buddhism, Confucianism, and Catholicism through China, as well as Protestantism which was brought directly from the West. We will explore how Koreans not only transformed these imported traditions and incorporated elements of their own indigenous traditions to meet their own religious needs, but also served as active agents or participants in the development, for example, of pan-East Asian religious traditions such as Hwaom/Huayan/ Kegon Buddhism.</description>
