<description>This course focuses on African American English and discourse and provides a critical exploration into the notions of language life, death and power. It is concerned with the language, discourse and symbolic systems that construct and represent race, class and gender in the US. We use methods from linguistic anthropology and philosophy to explore language ideologies and the relationship between power and powerful speech. In this course we will review and critique theories of language, communication, culture, and identity as they relate to ethnicity, race, gender, and power. In particular, we are interested in how language mediates and constructs identity, how we associate language with race, class and gender, and how we resist and manipulate these associations. To answer these questions we examine both public and popular culture, as well as education, literature, film and other media. Topics include: Discourse of Politics, Race, Class, Radical Language Theory and Ideology, Breaking and Making Linguistic Rules. Marking Blackness, Normalizing Blackness, Grammaticalization and Ideology.</description>
