<description>The Russian and Soviet empires acted both as direct agents of transformation and as facilitators of cross-cultural contact in Central Asia, shaping the region in both intended and unintended ways. This course will examine the patterns of cultural change in Central Asia in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries while investigating possible parallels to other contexts of colonial rule and cultural "globalization" worldwide. What role did factors like violence, the dissemination of new ideas and goods, and the creation of an indigenous elite play in bringing about cultural change? In what ways were imperial rule and cross-cultural contact disruptive to local societies, and in what ways (and for whom) were they productive? What opportunities were there for exercising individual agency and what were the constraints on it? Topics discussed in the course will include Islam, gender, national identities, and clan and tribal relationships.</description>
