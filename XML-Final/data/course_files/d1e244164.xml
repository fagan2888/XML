<description>In 1960 the Harvard Art Museums acquired an album composed of sketches, designs, and finished drawings (no. 1960.161). The 57 album folios preserve these valuable resources, with the artworks arranged singly or in groups on each page. The corpus constitutes the materia technica used by artists to make objects in different media, principally lacquered pen boxes and mirror cases, which were purchased from the bazaar by members of Qajar society and Europeans who visited Iran between the early 1800s and 1900s. The album has not yet been the subject of close study, despite the fact that it is the richest resource of its kind known today. The goal of the seminar is to examine the album and its contents from different perspectives, the period in which it was made, to prepare for the album's exhibition and publication as a monograph in 2017.</description>
