<description>This seminar on eighteenth-century novels and their philosophical surrounds situates itself at a crossroads where the histories of epistemology, the senses, and belief (both in God and in fictions) intersect. The Enlightenment described itself as the moment when an educated populace, weaned from superstition, would begin to see the world in its true colors: knowledge was to replace credulity. Our task will be to investigate its writers' investment in replaying the benighted, "Gothic" delusions they were meant to have put behind them. Our readings will encompass novels by Defoe, Lennox, Walpole, Radcliffe, and others, which we'll read alongside eighteenth-century philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, and twenty-first-century discussions of magic and secularism.</description>
