<description>The purpose of the course is to investigate the evangelical tradition from its origins in the religious revivals of the eighteenth century to its contemporary role in American culture, society and politics. Notwithstanding its often stereotypical characterizations, the evangelical tradition is surprisingly eclectic and complex. A central objective of the course, therefore, is to explore that complexity in relation to gender, ethnicity, social class, and political culture. The course will make use of primary and secondary materials to shed light on evangelical theology, spirituality, and cultural expression in America and in a global context.</description>
