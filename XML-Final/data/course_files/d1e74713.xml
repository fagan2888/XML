<description>In this course we will consider the range of meanings encompassed by the term qing in early Chinese texts, from newly-discovered manuscripts and the "Classics" of Confucian and Daoist thought, through a variety of major works of the "received" philosophical tradition. We will consider the semantic and rhetorical paths by which earlier uses of this key concept are turned in the direction of the issue of human feeling and the cult of desire that it commonly expresses in late-Imperial and modern intellectual discourse. The selected texts will be made available for reading in both the original Chinese and in English translations to be provided for the course.</description>
