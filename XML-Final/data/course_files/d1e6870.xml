<description>This course examines anthropological theory, research and practice that relates to constructions of blackness as well as African-diasporic identities. African-diasporic contributions to anthropology as well as anthropological research and theory concerning Africana identities will be explored. This course introduces students to basic concepts and qualitative methods in the social sciences including ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of face-to-face communication. It focuses on the details of everyday activities across a number of communities and interactive environments. It is meant to provide a bridge between communications, the social sciences, linguistics and socio-cultural anthropology through the introduction of concepts and analytical techniques that privilege observation, participation, video recording and transcription of spontaneous interaction (as opposed to experimental tasks or introspection).</description>
