<description>Newtonian mechanics and special relativity for students with good preparation in physics and mathematics at the level of the advanced placement curriculum. Topics include oscillators damped and driven and resonance (how to rock your car out of a snow bank or use a swing), an introduction to Lagrangian mechanics and optimization, symmetries and Noether's theorem, special relativity, collisions and scattering, rotational motion, angular momentum, torque, the moment of inertia tensor (dynamic balance), gravitation, planetary motion, and a quantitative introduction to some of the mind-bending ideas of modern cosmology like inflation and dark energy.</description>
<prerequisites>Score of 5 on the mechanics section of the Physics C Advanced Placement exam, or equivalent. Mathematics preparation at least at the level of Mathematics 21a taken concurrently is required. Thorough knowledge of calculus of one variable and vectors plus some mathematical sophistication. The mathematical level will be significantly higher than that of Physics 15a.</prerequisites>
<notes>Principles of Scientific Inquiry (PSI) is the laboratory component of Physics 16. Topics include experimental design, model testing, error analysis, basic programming, oral presentations, and scientific writing. PSI will meet weekly throughout the semester. Emphasis is placed on collaborative teaching and learning. Many class materials are Mathematics notebooks. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe or Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, but not both.</notes>
