<prerequisites/>
<notes>Not open to auditors. Course offered only by application and upon approval by the Director of the Language Program. Students must demonstrate clear academic need for the tutorial (e.g., knowledge of the language contributes to thesis research, other course work, planned study/research/internships abroad, etc.). Mere academic interest in the language is not sufficient for approval. Application information is available at the Slavic Department website. Interested students should submit on-line applications to staff assistant, Jolanta Davis, slavic@fas.harvard.edu, preferably by the second day of classes. No applications accepted after Friday of the first week of classes.</notes>
