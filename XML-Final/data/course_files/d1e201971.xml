<description>What difference does our Constitution make? Does it matter whether we think about it only as a text, as living practice, or as a set of mostly unwritten principles? This course will explore such questions by investigating several concrete constitutional controversies-about abortion, birth, and dying; about embryo research; about race and gender; about the Obama health insurance reform; about sexual intimacy and same-sex marriage; about religion, free speech, and campaign finance; about workers' rights; about informational privacy; and about emergency presidential action. Readings will be drawn from judicial and other writings about the Constitution, its history, and its interpretation.</description>
