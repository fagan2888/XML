<description>This class studies the basic elements of Buddhist thought, practice, and historical communities, and their vision of human flourishing. We will study Buddhist classic writings as well as later works from South, Central and East Asia on meditation, discipline, and creativity. Key themes of our readings are the relationship between self and other, the education of the emotions, paths of self-cultivation, and the (im)possibility of perfection. We will be especially attentive to how the approach to such things has shifted as Buddhism spread through Asia, and more recently to the rest of the world, as received by the 19th century Transcendentalists, the Beat poets, and socially engaged religion. Throughout the course we will consider the relevance of this material to our own views of the world and how we should lead our lives.</description>
