<description>This course will examine how women, through popular music, have articulated clear political analysis to their oppression that has reached large audiences and become foundational to American culture. We will begin with African-American blues in the early 20th century and moving through jazz, torch singing, folk, girl groups, disco, and contemporary song. Along their music readings we will include biographical, historical, and critical texts that will place these women in their artistic and political contexts. Performers studied will include, among others, Bessie Smith, the Boswell Sisters, Billie Holiday, Marian Anderson, Peggy Lee, Joan Baez, Gloria Gaynor, and Amy Winehouse.</description>
