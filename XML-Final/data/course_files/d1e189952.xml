<description>Modern society is unthinkable without the photograph, and yet we rarely have occasion to ponder what photographs are, what they do, and how they do it. In this course, we will consider photography from its origins to the digital era, paying particular attention to its role as an engine of belief in various cultural domains. Our goal will be to understand more incisively how photographs define and shape relations between their subjects and their viewers.</description>
