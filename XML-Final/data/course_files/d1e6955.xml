<description>The course focuses on language as a social construct and its importance and constitutive function in culture, appropriation, and performance of gender within and across traditional and national lines. The purpose of this course is to study, analyze and critique theories concerning the discursive construction of gender identity(s) and forms of representation of cultures. It will explore the relationship between power and powerful speech through reviews and critiques of theories of language, culture, and identity as they relate to gender, and nationalism. In particular, we will focus on how language and identity are constructed and mediated in literature, film and other media. Finally we will explore language and discourse surrounding women's language as well as language discourse styles used in the construction of regional, national, and global communities.</description>
