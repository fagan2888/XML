<description>Do your parents tell you stories about nuclear bomb drills in their elementary schools? Would you want to live in the same neighborhood as a nuclear power plant? Why did Stan Lee choose a radioactive spider to turn Peter Parker into Spider-Man? Our culture has strong ideas about radioactivity. How have those ideas changed over time? And how do they relate to the science of radioactivity? This seminar will explore the cultural history of radioactivity. Sample topics include newspaper coverage of nuclear science, ways people have prepared for possible nuclear catastrophes, and literature and films with nuclear themes.</description>
