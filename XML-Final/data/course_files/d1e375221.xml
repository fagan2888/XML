<description>Is literature animated by a "moral of the story," or by "art for art's sake"? This question was more than theoretical for modern Yiddish writers, who wrote at a crossroads between religious and secular life, under extraordinary circumstances. The course will explore how genre and belief interact in Yiddish stories, novels, poetry and drama over the past two centuries, as we closely examine the broader question of the purpose of art.</description>
