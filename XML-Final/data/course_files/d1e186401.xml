<description>This course is designed to enable students to analyze a wide range of Japanese cultural creations-including the traditional Noh theater, modern Japanese paintings, and contemporary anime-by illustrating the influence of Buddhism both on their forms and at their depths. The first part of the course is a study of major Buddhist philosophy and its impact on Japanese literature. The second part observes Buddhist ritual practices and their significance for Japanese performing arts. The last part traces the development of Japanese Buddhist art, and considers the influence of Buddhism on diverse contemporary popular Japanese art media.</description>
