<faculty_text>Peter J. Burgard (Germanic Languages and Literatures)</faculty_text>
<description>Examines German and Austrian art and literature of the Turn-of-the-Century (c. 1880-1920) with a focus on the dominant topics of sexuality, gender, and language that are articulated theoretically in the work of Nietzsche and Freud and insistently exemplified thematically and formally in both the art and literature of the age. The examination of this period, these theories, this art, and this literature serves the primary purpose of developing skills in the interpretation of literary texts and the plastic arts, as well as exploring the possibilities and productivity of bringing these arts and the interpretation of them to bear on one another.</description>
