CSCI-E 18 FALL 2014 Assignment 3 Part 1 Designing and Defining XML

Change 1
I realized that the <credit> elements and the <image> element had essentially the same data so I combined the two elements into one element named <credit>. I also placed all of the data into attributes for faster processing.

	Original
		<credit>NOAA's National Weather Service</credit>
    		<credit_URL>http://weather.gov/</credit_URL>
   		<image>
        		<url>http://weather.gov/images/xml_logo.gif</url>
        		<title>NOAA's National Weather Service</title>
        		<link>http://weather.gov</link>
    		</image>

	Improved
		<credit url="http://weather.gov" src="http://weather.gov/images/xml_logo.gif" title="NOAA's 		National Weather Service"/>



Change 2
I combined the metadata in all of the wind elements into one element with the data as attributes for faster processing and to make it easier to read. I also chose to remove the <wind_string> because I feel that is more of a display concern that can be created with xsl.


	Original
		<wind_string>from the Southwest at 12.7 gusting to 18.4 MPH (11 gusting to 16 KT)</wind_string>
    		<wind_dir>Southwest</wind_dir>
    		<wind_degrees>240</wind_degrees>
    		<wind_mph>12.7</wind_mph>
    		<wind_gust_mph>18.4</wind_gust_mph>
    		<wind_kt>11</wind_kt>
    		<wind_gust_kt>16</wind_gust_kt>ckup>
    		
	Improved
		<wind dir="Southwest" degrees="240" mph="12.7" gust_mph="18.4" kt="11" gust_kt="16"/>		


Change 3
I changed the <location/> elements by adding attributes that were once elements that made more sense as attributes of location since it is metadata. I added the geo namespace to add even more meaning to the data that can be utilized.


	Original
		<location>Boston, Logan International Airport, MA</location>
   	 	<station_id>KBOS</station_id>
    		<latitude>42.38</latitude>
   		<longitude>-51.03</longitude>
	Improved
		<location station_id="KBOS" geo:lat="42.38" geo:long="-51.03" 
		display="Boston, Logan International Airport, MA"/> 		


Change 4
I changed the elements groups that held metadata for <temperature>, <dewpoint> and <windchill> and combined them into one element named <readings> with attributes and nested elements with attributes for easier reading and faster processing. I also removed the strings which is more of a display choice that can be handled with xsl.

	Original
		<temperature_string>51.0 F (10.6 C)</temperature_string>
    		<temp_f>51.0</temp_f>
   		<temp_c>10.6</temp_c>

		<dewpoint_string>30.0 F (-1.1 C)</dewpoint_string>
    		<dewpoint_f>30.0</dewpoint_f>
    		<dewpoint_c>-1.1</dewpoint_c>
    		
		<windchill_string>46 F (8 C)</windchill_string>
    		<windchill_f>46</windchill_f>
    		<windchill_c>8</windchill_c>
	Improved
		<readings system="english" units="Farenheit" label="&#176;F">
        		<temperature value="51.0"/>
        		<dewpoint value="30.0"/>
        		<windchill value="46.0"/>
    		</readings>
    		
		<readings system="metric" units="Celsius" label="&#176;C">
        		<temperature value="10.6"/>
        		<dewpoint value="-1.1"/>
        		<windchill value="8"/>
    		</readings>		


Change 5
I nested all of the urls into a group under the element <urls> and made their text values attributes for faster processing. 

	Original
		<icon_url_base>http://forecast.weather.gov/images/wtf/small/</icon_url_base>						<two_day_history_url>http://www.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KBOS.html</two_day_history_url>
